== Description ==

This plugin demonstrates how to do batch operations in WordPress. 
Typically, long running operations such as migrations will lead to a timeout in the web browser. 
For instance, batch creating thousands of posts will likely fail in the web browser due to the response from your web server.
With this example, we demonstrate how you can have ajax and your web browser do stuff without timing out.
