wordpress-demos
===============

Demo code to learn how basic wordpress stuff works.

Sometimes the Wordpress Codex can be a little overwhelming or lacking to any
beginning programmer, so I'm creating this set of plugins to demo
basic functionality as I learn how to work with wordpress.

Coming from the Drupal world, I've found that the Codex could use more examples
compared to drupal.org. 

Sometimes I wish that I can find a simple examples module/plugin like you can find
on drupal.org:  http://drupal.org/project/examples

For instance, the books example plugin here was tied together from 5 or 6
pages of the codex. I couldn't find a working downloadable plugin that I
could install and start working on.


I'm including in this set of plugins:
* Books - example plugin to demo how to create a custom type using a plugin. Shows how to create custom meta box.
* Widget Dropdown Demo - example to show how to create a dropdown selector inside of a widget, and save this info.
* Customize Theme Menu Mod - example how to add options to the customize menu to override some color options on the fly. This also injects css into your theme.
