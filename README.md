===============

Demo code to learn how basic wordpress stuff works.

Wordpress Codex is terrible, so I'm creating this set of plugins to demo 
basic functionality as I learn how to work with wordpress.
Coming from the Drupal world, I've found that the Codex is TERRIBLE compared
to drupal.org. I can't find a simple examples module/plugin like you can find
on drupal.org:  http://drupal.org/project/examples

For instance, the books example plugin here was tied together from 5 or 6 
pages of the codex. I couldn't find a working downloadable plugin that I 
could install and start working on.  

It seems like wordpress folks are experts at SEO, because the results 
on google just rehashed the same crap from the codex without a fully working 
example.
